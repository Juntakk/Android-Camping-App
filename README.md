Camping and Activity reservations mini app

Hello,

This is one of the many apps i developed in school, use of Java and Android studio and SQLite.

The database info should be in the "Reservations" file but if for some reason it doesn't work,
the app is not fully dependant on the database as the user can add and remove data and visualize it
directly in the app.

Enjoy !
